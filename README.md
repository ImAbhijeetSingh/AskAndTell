# AskAndTell

It is a simple **Forum Web Application** that I made for my college project. Their users can **ASK QUESTIONS AND TELL ANSWERS**. It has many features like other Forum Applications that are listed below:


## Features
1. It has Register and log-in functionality. However, the user needs not to log in if he just wants to check questions and answers.
2. Registered users can comment on questions and answers.
3. User can ask any question. He can add 3 tags with his question. Someone can see all the questions with a particular tag if he/she will click on that tag. 
4. Users can also sort questions with a number of answers and dates. 
5. Every question has an UpVote and DownVote option.
6. Every User has a Reputations point. With every UpVote he got 5 Reputation Points and with every DownVote, he looses 5 Reputations points.
